# ATAR WACE Archive - the largest archive of past papers.

### CLICK HERE TO ACCESS THE ARCHIVE:

Please read the notice on the website.

Archive of past WACE/ATAR course exams and papers.
The site hosts papers going as far back as 2006 and has rare papers which are no longer hosted on the official SCSA website. Papers from both the current ATAR system and old WACE Stage 3 (3A/3B or 3C/3D) system.
You can bulk-download papers by getting a command generated by the site, in powershell and bash with cURL.

We are looking particularly for stage 3 exam marking keys and other unique or rare papers. Submit papers by raising an issue at:

This project could not have been possible without the Internet Archive, who hosts all the files - this site is only an interface to access these files easier.
